# Node.js Learning Repo 🚀

This repository is a collection of notes, examples, and mini-projects I’m building while learning **Node.js**.  
It’s meant as a personal playground, but feel free to poke around!

## 📂 Structure
- `basics/` → simple scripts exploring core Node.js features  
- `modules/` → experiments with built-in and custom modules  
- `projects/` → small apps to practice concepts  
- `notes.md` → quick reference notes  

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)  
- npm (comes bundled with Node)  

Check your versions:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
🌱 Goals

Understand Node.js fundamentals

Practice asynchronous programming

Build small, practical apps

Get comfortable with npm packages

Want me to make it a bit more **fun and beginner-friendly** (with emojis and casual wording), or more **professional** (straightforward and documentation-style)?
